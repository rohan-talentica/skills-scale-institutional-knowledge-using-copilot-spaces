# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README serves as the central entry point for all OctoAcme project management documentation. It provides an overview of project management processes and quick access to each key process document.

## Overview: OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative, and evidence-informed project management approach. Projects move through the phases of initiation, planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement, with clear roles, defined artifacts, and regular communication. Our processes ensure repeatable delivery, risk awareness, and stakeholder alignment across the lifecycle.
